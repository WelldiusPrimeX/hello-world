# hello-world
my first of many repositories on github
Over the years i have tried my hands on several programming languages,
but more recently i have focused more on the frontend pathway.
i have learnt html and css atleast to an intermediate level and everytime i come across a concept
i am not familiar with i can easily consult online resources for help erly on i registered with pirple.com
enrolled for the frontend fundamentals course and finshed it by takin a final examination which involved building apple website with nothing but html and css,
and i was awarded a certificate.
the obvoius next step was javascript and i am proud to say that i have taken courses from very talented tutors  from scrimba to freecode camp
to john smilga on udemy.
so i am currently working on several vanilla projects to sharpen my skills before going into React.
