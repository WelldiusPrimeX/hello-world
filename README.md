# hello-world
My first of many repositories on github.
Over the years i have tried my hands on several programming languages,
but more recently i have focused more on the frontend pathway.
I have learnt HTML and CSS atleast to an intermediate level and everytime i come across a concept
I am not familiar with i can easily consult online resources for help, early on i registered with pirple.com,
enrolled for the frontend fundamentals course and finshed it by taking a final examination which involved building apple website with nothing but HTML and CSS,
and i was awarded a certificate.
The obvious next step was javascript and i am proud to say that i have taken courses from very talented tutors  from scrimba to freecode camp
to john smilga on udemy.
I am currently working on several vanilla Javascript projects to sharpen my skills before going into React.Js.
